## Description

ClipCutter is software that aims to simplify the management of video game clips. This software is written in C++ within the Qt framework. It is designed to tackle the challenge of dealing with large numbers of gaming clips, allowing users to efficiently cut and optimize their clips for storage. ðŸŽ®ðŸ’¾

## What's New in v2

In the newest release, ClipCutter has been completely reimagined and rebuilt from the ground up. I've focused on enhancing both functionality and user experience, making it easier and more enjoyable to use:

### New User Interface

I've streamlined the design to provide an intuitive and user-friendly experience. Navigating and managing your clips is much easier when comparing to previous versions.

## Installation

Installing ClipCutter is a breeze. Follow these steps to get started:

### Download
Download the latest [release](https://github.com/Jimmy-Baby/ClipCutter/releases/download/v2.1.0/ClipCutter.v2.1.0.zip)

### Extract
Extract the files into the folder of your choosing, this is where ClipCutter will live.

Right click ClipCutter.exe -> Send to... -> Desktop (Create Shortcut) to create a shortcut on your Desktop.

### Run
Open ClipCutter either from the shortcut or directly from the folder!

## Usage

Here's how you can use it:

1. **Import Clips:** Open the clips you want to cut using any of the options shown in the 'File' menu.
2. **Trim and Cut:** Set the start/end points for each clip to reduce their length. Optionally, you can rename them and even create common keywords using the keywords manager to add prefixes to clips!
3. **Cull Unwanted Clips:** Identify and remove clips you no longer need by checking the 'Skip?' checkbox next to them in the video list.
4. **Enjoy Optimized Storage:** Choose your output settings using the dropdowns, and then click the 'Process Clips' button. You can find your processed clips in the ClipCutterOutput found in the original clip directory.
