## Description

ClipCutter is a project I made to simplify the management of video game clips.
It is written in C++, within the Qt framework.
It is designed to tackle the challenge of dealing with a large number of videos at once.

## Installation

Installing ClipCutter is easy:

### Download
Download the latest [release](https://github.com/Jimmy-Baby/ClipCutter/releases/download/v2.1.1/ClipCutter.v2.1.1.zip)

### Extract
Extract the files into a folder, this is where ClipCutter will live.

Right click ClipCutter.exe -> Send to... -> Desktop (Create Shortcut) to create a shortcut on your Desktop.

## Usage

Here's how you can use it:

1. Open the clips you want to cut using any of the options shown in the 'File' menu.
2. Set the start/end points for each clip to reduce their length. Optionally, you can rename them and create common keywords using the keywords manager to add prefixes to clips.
3. Remove clips you don't want to keep at all checking the 'Skip?' checkbox next to them in the video list.
4. Choose your output settings using the dropdowns, and then click the 'Process Clips' button. You can find your processed clips in the ClipCutterOutput found in the original clip directory.
